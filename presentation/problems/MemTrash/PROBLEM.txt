Limak bear is hungry.
Food is far away from Limak so Limak need help solving problem.

Given an undirected unweighted graph, determine all nodes that are connected to a given node.

Limak was very hungry, so he came up with bad, RE solution. Help Limak find his food.

#Input
Integers N, M, Q (1 < N,M < 100000) are given on the first line.
N is the number of nodes in the graph, M is the number of edges, and Q is the query node.
The next M lines contain integer vertex pairs (u, v) that describe a single edge of the graph.
The graph is valid, and there are no disjoint segments.

#Output
Output every node that is connected to the query node, Q, each on a separate line.
