Jake is in his interview with a blockchain startup that's coming out with a new game called KryptoAlligators.
His interview question is to determine if a series of given values are in a sorted array.
To make things more challenging, Jake isn't allowed to use hashing.
Usually, Jake solves problems by implementing the brute force first,
then adding HashMaps wherever he feels like it,
so he is quite stuck.

Jake wants to help make the world a better place with his passion for blockchain,
so help him on his interview by improving his code!

#Input
On the first line are the positive integers N and Q (1 <= N, Q <= 100,000) in ascending order,
where N is the number of elements in the array and Q is the number of search queries.
On the second line, there are N spaced positive integers q_i (1 < q_1 < 100,000).
On the next Q lines are single positive integers, the search queries.

#Output
Output Q lines, one for each query. On the ith line, if q_i is in the array, print "yes", 
otherwise, print "no".
