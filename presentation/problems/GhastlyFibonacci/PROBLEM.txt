Aarav was caught cheating on the weekly PCS contests from home.
As punishment, he is required to solve the classic "return the nth Fibonacci number" problem.
The catch is that he can't use pypy or Python, and must type everything using only his nose.

Aarav finally finishes typing up a long and clumsy Java solution.
He is so tired and behind in the contest that he submits his solution without testing it.
Unfortunately, his solution times out.
His code is provided below.
Help him figure out what went wrong, so Aarav can go back to using his hands to code again.

#Input
The first line contains a positive integer Q (1 < 1000), the number of queries.
The next Q lines each contain a single positive integer q_i (1 < q_1 < 40).

#Output
Output Q lines. On the ith line, print the q_ith Fibonacci number.
