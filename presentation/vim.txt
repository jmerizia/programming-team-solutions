show learning curve picture

Beginners (30 mins):
- Opening VIM
- Basic commands (:w :q :e)
- How to look at the keyboard:
  - "Using vim is like trying to use a keyboard
    in your room, but your room is locked, so you
	have to do it with a coat hanger through the
	lock of the door."
  - Each key is bound to some function or mode
  - Don't try pressing random keys!
- Moving around (hjkl b e w)
- Insert mode
- highlighting (v and V) <-- Dr. Back
- modifying without insert mode (d dd)
- Explorer (good for beginners)
- Panes
- Good Resources (Listed at bottom)

Advanced (30min):
- Combining (Command + location)
    cw dw de
    ciw viw ci{ ci[ diw di{
- Repeating Commands (with .)
- Hashtag Powerful
  - Lookup (just #)
  - e# to switch
- Search with / and jump with n N
- Now things get juicy
  - Look at example code, rename all variables apple to orange (IDE's have features for this)
- Intro to VIMRC and "map"
    - Adding semicolons to end of lines (stop using right arrow key, please it hurts my heart)
        map ;; $a;<Esc>
- Copy/Pasting (registers)
- Capital J
- SHIFT-O bug (why you should use neovim if possible)
- CONTROL-O (not a bug)
- Jumping between blocks ("{" and "}")
  - Good reason to use empty lines in your code
  - Using VIM can change your coding style
- Indentation << >>
- Commenting code blocks
  - Visual Block Mode and SHIFT-I trick
    CTRL-V

Extras (if time permit): 
- Plugins (do I need them?) My Favorite:
  - NERDTree
  - Auto-Pairs
- No scrolling????? BUT WHY?? Use this:
    map <C-j> <C-e>j:sleep 1m<CR><C-e>j:sleep 1m<CR><C-e>j:sleep 1m<CR><C-e>j:sleep 1m<CR><C-e>j:sleep 1m<CR><C-e>j
    map <C-k> <C-y>k:sleep 1m<CR><C-y>k:sleep 1m<CR><C-y>k:sleep 1m<CR><C-y>k:sleep 1m<CR><C-y>k:sleep 1m<CR><C-y>k
- Recording Macros
    noremap Q @q
- Fixing lost swap file


Conclusion:
- You won't become very good overnight
- It takes time to be a VIM ninja
- But once you are a ninja, you're a ninja and you won't be able to hang out with regular people
