Can you get to the top of the wall, starting from the bottom?
- You must be holding at least two rocks at any point.
- Points at integer coordinates.
- You are a particle, with four "arms" that can reach anywhere within a given radius R of the particle.
- The particle starts at y = 0, and must try to place itself at y = H.
- N particles, W = width, H = height, (xi, yi) = rock position
- Allow for O(N^2)

Input:
W H N R
x1 y2
x2 y2
...
xN yN
